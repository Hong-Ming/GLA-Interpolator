## Prerequisite and Setup
1. CVX [6] installed (Optional), you can use the solver in `BCD_Algorithm/` to run the code.
2. Run `startup` to setup search paths and required directories.
   ```
   >>startup
   ```
3. This program stores the outputs and learned parameters in `Data/` to speed up implementation, run `cleanup` to cleanup those data
   ```
   >>cleanup
   ```
