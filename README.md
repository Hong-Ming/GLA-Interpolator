## Intorduction
This MATLAB program contains the code for the paper "Graph learning and augmentation based interpolation of signal strength for location-aware communications". The code for the interpolator using Gaussian Process [2] and Kriging [3] are also included to perform comparison and Monta Carlo simulation.

## SETUP/INSTALLATION
1. Require CVX [6] installed
2. Search paths and required directories will be create automatically as
   startup.m will automatically executed at startup.
3. If your startup directory is not GLA/ or there are errors occurs due to 
   'Function is not found on MATLAB searth path' or 'No such file or directory',
   please execute startup.m manually.
